<p>I'm Ben Betz, an engineering manager at Microsoft.</p>
<p>This is my personal blog, where I intend to write about the engineering principles I've learned throughout my career, primarily around project management. I've discovered that despite many great resources for learning agile, waterfall, and hybrid models, this is still a skill that takes a long time to develop, and is not taught formally on the job. Thus I hope my occasional writings here help others avoid re-learning some of the lessons I have.</p>
<p>I view this blog as a creative outlet, and a chance to share my thoughts that go beyond my day to day work responsibilities.  I'll also likely include some posts about fun projects, such as setting up this blog using Jekyll in WSL2, edited in VSCode, as well as my fledgling efforts to automate the Lego Roller Coaster with an Arduino.</p>
<p><i>Fun personal fact:</i> In spare time of years past, I've also been a semi-professional photographer and scuba instructor. I was also a competitive swimmer from childhood through university, hence my blog name (and twitter handle).</p>
